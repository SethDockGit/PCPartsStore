# PCPartsStore

A C# CRUD Console Application for a PC parts store that allows users to order from an inventory. Manages quantity for each item in the inventory in real time to prevent orders for out of stock items and maintains an order history for the user to edit and delete as they wish. Implemented with in-memory test data source as well as an option for persistent text data for the userbase and inventory, with dependency injection allowing for toggling between the two data sources. Uses enumeration to distinguish regular and premium users, with a discount for premium users applied at checkout. XUnit tests for the logic and data layers guarantee the proper function of each method.
