# PCPartsStore

A C# CRUD Console Application for a PC parts store that allows users to order from an inventory. Manages quantity of each item in the inventory in real time to prevent orders of out of stock items and maintains an order history for the user to edit and delete. Implemented with in-memory test data source as well as an option for persistent data storage in local files for the user base and inventory, with dependency injection allowing for toggle between the two data sources. Uses enumeration to distinguish regular and premium users, with a discount for premium users applied at checkout. XUnit tests for the logic and data layers guarantee the proper function of each method.
